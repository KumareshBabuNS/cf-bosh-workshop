Lab 1: 

. Testing your Bosh-Lite environment

  .. Use Vagrant to start bosh-lite VM
  
   -- run "$git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite.git "
    
        -- cd into the /bosh-lite directory run "$vagrant up" and test "$vagrant ssh"
        
    -- Vagrant exposes ssh port on host machine @ 2222
    
        test "$ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p2222 "
        note: password should be a key (.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key ), but also can use “vagrant")
        
 .. Bosh Lite director is running inside the Vagrant vm @ 192.168.50.4
 
    - bosh user is admin, password is “admin"
    
    -- run "$bosh target 192.168.50.4"
    
    -- run "bosh login"
    
    -- Use "$bin/add-route" command from /bosh-lite directory to add a static rout to containers via VM
    
        - Note: this add-route file may _NOT BE CORRECT_ for the 10.68.45.0/24 network configured in the Postgres release deployment manifest link:https://github.com/mgunter-pivotal/cf-bosh-workshop/blob/master/bosh-postgres-release/complete/postgres-bosh-release/postgres.yml[here]
        
        -Here are the recommended "add-route" file settings for this workshop:
    ----
    old_ips="10.68.0.0/16"
    ips="10.68.0.0/16"
    gw="192.168.50.4"
    ----
    
    -- check the status of bosh with "$bosh status"

. Testing your PCFDev environment

  .. Use Vagrant to start PCFDev VM
  
   -- run "$git clone https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcfdev.git "
    
        -- update Vagrantfile to port map host port 2223 (instead of 2222)
        ----
         config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
           v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", resources[:memory]]
           v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", resources[:cpus]]
           v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--ioapic", "on"]
           v.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--paravirtprovider", "minimal"]
           config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 22, host: 2223
         end
        ----
        
        -- cd into the /bosh-lite directory  run "$vagrant up" and test "$vagrant ssh"
        
    -- Vagrant will then expose the guest ssh port on host machine @ 2223
    
        test "$ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p2223 "
        note: password should be a key (.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key ), but also can use “vagrant")
        
 . PCF is running inside the Vagrant vm @ 192.168.11.11

    .. To login to Pcfdev via the CLI
    
    --$  cf login -a api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation <admin/admin>
    
    .. To verify PCF commandline tool connected
    
    --$ cf target
