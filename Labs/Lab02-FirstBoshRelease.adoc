-- Lab02: Building your first Bosh Release

. Running Bosh from within MBPro, but can’t ssh into failed container after deploy

    - So, use #1 above to get into VM
    
    - use "bosh create release --dir postgres-release --force” from home directory
    
    - use “bosh upload release --dir postgres-release"
    
    - use “ vi /postgres-release/postgres.yml” to add the right version
    
    - use “bosh deploy —recreate” to run
    
    - use “bosh ssh --strict_host_key_checking no” to ssh into container. can look around and then sudo ****, prompted for password
    
    - For sudo password, try [ENTER] 3 times….then it works?
    
    - recall using sudo su - vcap to run scripts in proper context/user space
