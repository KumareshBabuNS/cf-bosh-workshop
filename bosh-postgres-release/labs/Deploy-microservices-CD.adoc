= Deploying microservices with Pivotal CF using a CI pipeline in Jenkins

== Script 

=== __1st Exercise: Developing microservices with Spring WebMVC and SpringBoot__

* Clone the repository at https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/PCF-demo, branch "micro-services"
----
git clone https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/PCF-demo -b micro-services
----
* Analize the source code and identify the micro-services, the dependencies and how easy it is to create those.
* Check against the 12 Factor App concepts you've learned and identify gaps.
* If you want to make any changes, fork the repository, change your own copy and make a Pull Request.

=== __2nd Exercise: CI pipeline__
  
* Login to a Jenkins server. 
* Explore the existing projects, their build status and logs.
* Now let's create a new CI pipeline for you. On the left menu, click "New Item".
* Choose "Freestyle Project". Give it the name "microservices-bootcamp-<yourname>". Please use this convention so we can recycle these after the bootcamp.
* On "Github project", enter "https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/PCF-demo"
* On source code management, click "GIT" and enter the following repository info:
- Repository URL: https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/PCF-demo
- Branch: */micro-services
* On "Build Triggers", select "Build when a change is pushed to GitHub"
* On "Build Environment", select "Maven3-Artifactory Integration". Select  "http://10.68.96.68/artifactory" as Artifactory Server. Click "Refresh Repositories" and select the following repositories: "ext-release-local" for releases and "ext-snapshot-local" for snapshots. Also select "Capture and publish build info". Please *don't* select "Deploy artifacts to Artifactory", as our Artifactory server is very limited on spacing.
* On "Build", setup as following:
- Invoke Maven 3:  Root pom "PCFDemo-map/pom.xml", goal "install"
- Execute Shell:
----
DEPLOYED_VERSION_CMD=$(CF_COLOR=false cf apps | grep 'mapUS.' | cut -d" " -f1)
export BUILD_VERSION="1.2"
export DEPLOYED_VERSION_CMD
echo DEPLOYED_VERSION_CMD
export ROUTE_VERSION="default"
echo "Deployed Version: $DEPLOYED_VERSION"
echo "Route Version: $ROUTE_VERSION"
export API=http://<your_cf_api>

cf api --skip-ssl-validation $API
cf login -u <user> -p <password> -o <org> -s <space>

cf create-service p-rabbitmq standard demo-rabbit

cf push PCFDemo-producer -f PCFDemo-producer/manifest.yml --no-start 
cf push PCFDemo-map -f PCFDemo-map/manifest.yml --no-start 

cf bind-service PCFDemo-producer demo-rabbit
cf bind-service PCFDemo-map demo-rabbit

cf restart PCFDemo-producer
cf restart PCFDemo-map
----

* If you'd like to add any additional steps (like smoke tests) to the build, add as a "Post Build Action".
* Save changes.
* Detail your new project. On the menu, click "Build now". 
* As a new build starts, detail it and click on "Console Output" to see the build / deploy real-time logging info.
* Do any troubleshoot needed until you have a clean build.
* Congratulations! You have created your CI pipeline. Please delete your Jenkins project after you're done.
